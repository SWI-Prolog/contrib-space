---++ INSTRUCTIONS

Make sure you have SWI-Prolog 5.6.64.
Otherwise, if you have SWI-Prolog 5.6.63 you can substitute SWI-cpp.h in Prolog's include directory by the version in the adaptations directory of this package.

Install spatialindex. (Use spatialindex release >= 1.3.3, the current source in the Trac repository at http://trac.gispython.org/spatialindex , or the version supplied with this package in the adaptations directory.)
Install GEOS. The space package has been tested with version 3.1.1.

If you install spatialindex or geos with a prefix (with ./configure --prefix=$PREFIX),
make sure that the directory where the spatialindex library or geos library was installed,
e.g. /usr/local/lib, is in the environment variables LD_LIBRARY_PATH and LIBRARY_PATH.
Make sure that the directory where the spatialindex header files were installed,
e.g. /usr/local/include, is in the environment variable CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH.

On unixlike systems using bash, for example, you could add this to your .bashrc or .bash_profile before running ./configure --prefix=$PREFIX:
export PREFIX=/home/yourself
export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=$PREFIX/include
export LIBRARY_PATH=$PREFIX/lib
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PREFIX/lib

There is no installation procedure for this demo yet, but you can run the demo from the shared object file in the current working directory.

run:
autoconf
autoheader
./configure
make test
make demo

If the compilation finished without errors the demo script will prompt you with instructions.

If it does not work, please contact me.
