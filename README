---++ INSTRUCTIONS

Make sure you have the latest development version of SWI-Prolog 5.7.13. This is necessary for non-deterministic C++ predicates.

Install spatialindex. (Use spatialindex release >= 1.3.3, the current source in the Trac repository at http://trac.gispython.org/spatialindex , or the version supplied with this package in the adaptations directory.)
Install GEOS. The space package has been tested with version 3.1.1.

If you install spatialindex or geos with a prefix (with ./configure --prefix=$PREFIX),
make sure that the directory where the spatialindex library or geos library was installed,
e.g. /usr/local/lib, is in the environment variables LD_LIBRARY_PATH and LIBRARY_PATH.
Make sure that the directory where the spatialindex header files were installed,
e.g. /usr/local/include, is in the environment variable CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH.

On unixlike systems using bash, for example, you could add this to your .bashrc or .bash_profile before running ./configure --prefix=$PREFIX:
export PREFIX=/home/yourself
export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=$PREFIX/include
export LIBRARY_PATH=$PREFIX/lib
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PREFIX/lib

run:
autoconf
autoheader
./configure
make
make install
pl -s test_space.pl -g test_space,halt
pl -s demo_space.pl

-- Mac OS X
On Mac OS X you might have to help ./configure a bit by telling it how to call the preprocessor. This should work: 
CXXCPP="g++ -E" ./configure
Also, since 'pl' is a reserved command, Prolog should be called with 'swipl'.

If the compilation finished without errors the demo script will prompt you with instructions.

If it does not work, please contact me.
