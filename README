---+ INSTRUCTIONS

Make sure you have at least SWI-Prolog 5.7.13. This is necessary for
non-deterministic C++ predicates.

Install spatialindex. (Use spatialindex release >= 1.3.3 or the current
source in the Trac repository at
http://trac.gispython.org/spatialindex.) Install GEOS. The space package
has been tested with version 3.1.1.

An outline of the installation procedure (please let me know where it
fails with your setup) is listed below:

---++ Install GEOS

  ==
  $ svn checkout http://svn.osgeo.org/geos/trunk geos-svn
  $ cd geos-svn/trunk
  $ ./autogen.sh
  $ ./configure --prefix=[...]
  $ make
  $ sudo make install
  ==

---++ Install spatialindex

  ==
  $ git clone http://github.com/libspatialindex/libspatialindex
  $ cd libspatialindex
  $ ./autogen.sh
  $ ./configure --prefix=[...]
  $ make
  $ sudo make install
  ==

---++ Download the development version of SWI-Prolog

  ==
  $ git clone git://www.swi-prolog.org/home/pl/git/pl-devel.git
  ==

---++ Install SWI-Prolog and the space package

  ==
  $ cp build.templ build
  [add space to variable EXTRA_PKGS]
  $ ./prepare
  $ ./build
  ==

---++ run the tests and the demo

  ==
  $ cd packages/space
  $ pl -s demo_space.pl
  ==

---++ Mac OS X

On Mac OS X you might have to help ./configure a bit by telling it how
to call the preprocessor. This should work:

  ==
  CXXCPP="g++ -E" ./configure
  ==

Also, since 'pl' is a reserved command, Prolog should be called with
'swipl'.

If the compilation finished without errors the demo script will prompt
you with instructions.

If it does not work, please contact me.

---++ Ubuntu/Debian

This explains getting the prerequisites on Ubuntu/Debian. Tested on
Ubuntu Jaunty (9.04, 64-bits). Install the following packages (in
addition to what you need to build SWI-Prolog in the first place):

	sudo apt-get install libtool subversion libgeos-dev

Fetch and install spatialindex using the instructions above.

---++ Windows

To compile the space package as part of SWI-Prolog by running "/pl-devel/src/make.cmd" you need to put "space" in the list of packages in the PKGS variable in "/pl-devel/src/rules.mk".

---++ Problems with local installations of GEOS and spatialindex

If you install spatialindex or geos in a local directory, for example
your home directory, using a prefix (with ./configure --prefix=$PREFIX),
make sure that the directory where the spatialindex
library or geos library was installed, e.g. /usr/local/lib, is in the
environment variables LD_LIBRARY_PATH and LIBRARY_PATH. Make sure that
the directory where the spatialindex header files were installed, e.g.
/usr/local/include, is in the environment variable CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH.
Usually, this will work correctly automatically.

On unixlike systems using bash, for example, you could add this to your
.bashrc or .bash_profile before running ./configure --prefix=$PREFIX:

  ==
  export PREFIX=/home/yourself
  export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=$PREFIX/include
  export LIBRARY_PATH=$PREFIX/lib
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PREFIX/lib
